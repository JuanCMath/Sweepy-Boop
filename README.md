# SweepyBoop's Arena Helper
My lightweight addon to support arena plays.

Here is how my UI looks like:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78008331/226146638-ecd2f9d5-2276-4dbb-925f-157ff4e3a955.png)

Type **/sb** in game to invoke the options panel.

Every module can be toggled on/off, with a few customization options.

Most changes require a UI reload to take effect, and there is a Reload UI button below the settings for convinience.

## Friendly class and pet icons
For friendly players and their primary pets, places a class (for players) or pet (for pets) icon on top to replace the health bar.
- When selected, shows an orange highlight border.
- This makes it much easier to track where your teammates are during an arena match, especially for healers.
- <span style="color:#36f"><strong>There is an option to use a special icon for healers in your group!</strong></span> No more "where is my healer" scream in an intense arena game for DPS players
- This is a great alternative to enabling friendly nameplates, since it's not always easy to distinguish between enemy/friendly nameplates. Some players use a script to make friendly nameplates shorter, but then there is the issue with priest mind control, i.e., friendly nameplates can become default width, or enemy nameplates can become shorter width after mind control effect.

To make the most of this module, configure your name & nameplate settings as follows:

## Arena enemy offensive/defensive cooldown tracking
This module is a set of icons attached to (corresponding) arena enemy frames, which is very close to the tournament UI.

It comes with a few key features:
- Glows when spell is active, and shows cooldown timer otherwise (only the most important spells show cooldown timers)
- Sorts icons by priority/threat, e.g., on an Assassination Rogue, Deathmark will always show before other icons
- Filter by spec, e.g., only shows Convoke the Spirits for Balance/Feral Druids, but not Restoration Druids
- Cooldown reduction: for instance, Fury Warrior's Relentlessness cooldown reduced by spending rage, Fire Mage Combustion cooldown reduced by casting Fireball or crit damage

**Note (important)**
- This module supports Gladius and sArena
- Make sure to /reload if you change your Gladius / sArena settings (especially when you change the layout / positioning)
- This module only tracks damage offensives and defensive abilities, and currently there is no option to choose which abilities to track

## Sort raid frames
Sort raid frames inside arena. Currently supports player on top/bottom, or in the middle between party1 and party2.

## Arena Nameplate Numbers
Quality-of-life feature to replace arena enemy names on top of nameplates with arena numbers.

## Nameplate filtering
While in arena, only show enemy player nameplates and important non-player units, e.g.,
- For Beast Mastery Hunter pets, only show the primary one, so you know which one to kill
- For warlocks, only show the pet, not the 1,000 wild imps

In short, this module shows the minimal set of unit nameplates that you need to keep an eye on during an arena match.




#### Note
Currently this module only supports sArena, since that's what I use.

If you use Gladius and want to use this module, feel free to make a feature request ðŸ˜Š

## Fix Blizzard raid frame aggro highlight
Blizzard's raid frame aggro highlight only tracks PvE threats. That means pet threats inside arenas, which is not very useful.

This module fixes that by highlighting the teammate who is targetted by enemy DPS players.

For this module to work, disable the following setting under Interface settings so that it stops showing PvE threats:
